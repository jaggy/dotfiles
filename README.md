## Note

### 2016-11-16

Okay, let's give **fish** another shot.

### 2016-09-2016

Remove support for italics, ligatures feel much better over than operator's italics. (at least for my preference)

### 2016-08-27

Reverting back to **zsh**. For some reason, it's breaking my setup. Maybe it's conflicting to tmux or the italics stuff.

### 2016-08-11

Switching from **zsh** to **fish**.

First impressions, I like the configuration right out of the box. Syntax highlighting, autocompletion and search on tab completion! (Not like I'll actually use them but, it's still nice.)

It's hard to migrate my zsh config to fish though, it's taking quite a bit of time to adjust from a very different shell scripting paradigm.

Operator Mono! Add support for italics.
