# Dotfiles

## Todo
- I wanna use emamux to change tmux's colors when I switch evil mode modes.
  - teal   - normal
  - red    - insert
  - purple - visual
  - black  - replace
  - Worst case, let's just use the mode line but I think this is a better challenge.
- Refactor the configuration.org into just normal elisp stuff.
- Find a way to colorize the modeline text.

## Note

Okay, let's give **fish** another shot.

Remove support for italics, ligatures feel much better over than operator's italics. (at least for my preference)

Reverting back to **zsh**. For some reason, it's breaking my setup. Maybe it's conflicting to tmux or the italics stuff.

Switching from **zsh** to **fish**.

First impressions, I like the configuration right out of the box. Syntax highlighting, autocompletion and search on tab completion! (Not like I'll actually use them but, it's still nice.)

It's hard to migrate my zsh config to fish though, it's taking quite a bit of time to adjust from a very different shell scripting paradigm.

Operator Mono! Add support for italics.
