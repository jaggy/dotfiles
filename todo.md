# Todo
- [] Add a DuskTestCase snippet `dtc<tab>`
- I wanna use emamux to change tmux's colors when I switch evil mode modes.
  - teal   - normal
  - red    - insert
  - purple - visual
  - black  - replace
  - Worst case, let's just use the mode line but I think this is a better challenge.
- [ ] Refactor the configuration.org into just normal elisp stuff.
- [x] Find a way to colorize the modeline text.
- Create a tmux script to change themes on the fly.
